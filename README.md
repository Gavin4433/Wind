Hi！ The Project you are looking at is called "Wind is not a decorator"!

Hi! 你正在看的这个项目叫做Wind!(Wind is not a decorator)

# **Why I write this?**
I think the original decorator is ... not so good, so...here we are!

我认为Python原来的装饰器不大好用，所以....你就看到了这个项目!

# **How To Use**
Just as the example.py

就像example.py一样!!!

# Why you launch the wrapped function using a strange way?
`launcher.run_func(WRAPPER, liang, globals(), "Hello", "liang")`

Hmm, That's a technical issue....
QAQ其实是自己技术不过关，解决不了....

If someone knows how to let the code looks like

`class WRAPPER(Wind.Wind):
....`

`def liang(...): ....  `

`test = Wind(liang)`

`test()`

`liang()`

And get the same result as mine, that will be fine.

So... can you tell me how to solve this problem?

如果哪位大佬知道怎么解决的话能告诉一下我吗QAQ
